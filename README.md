## Description

Welcome!  FriendZone is your friend-finding application, linking you with the people who most closely match your values and personality.  The site does its friendzoning by having the user take a survey about a range of topics.  Their results are stored and compared with our other users to find your most similar match.  Their match's name and photograph will be displayed so they can find that person and be the best of friends.

This application was built using a node.js server and it is deployed to heroku.  The webpages utilize jQuery, Bootstrap CSS, and Chosen to render the dropdown menus in a slightly more user-friendly format.  The server file accesses route files which in turn access the HTML files and the data files for the friend data.  The site also features an API that the users can access to look at the whole list of everyone else who took the survey and see their numerical responses to the questions.

This application was a heavy exercise routing with server files.  Also, it helped me research other front-end techniques for making the site look modern and user-friendly.
